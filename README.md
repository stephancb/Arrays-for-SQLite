# Arrays-for-SQLite
Extension for SQLite for accessing elements of arrays which are stored in blobs

Unlike Posgresql SQLite does not accept arrays as column types. The functions of this extension access elements of arrays which have been stored in blobs. Probably this is as close as SQLite can get to array column types.
